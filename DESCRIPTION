Description: This is package can be used to deconvolute the cell composition of liver bulk RNA-seq data. The cell markers for 20 cell types idnetified by the single RNA-Seq analysis of healthy liver tissue performed by MacParland et al.,2018. User need to provide a expression matrix having rownames as gene symbol and colnames as samples. The expression file should be normalized count value (TPM or FPKM).
