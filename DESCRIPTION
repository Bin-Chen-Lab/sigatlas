Description: This is package can be used to deconvolute the cell composition of any specified tissue using its bulk RNA-seq data. The cell markers identified in different healthy tissues by the single RNA-Seq analysis are used for deconvolution. User need to provide a expression matrix having rownames as gene symbol and colnames as samples. The expression file should be normalized count value (TPM or FPKM).
